													Big Drop was launched in 2016 and has won top prizes in beer awards across the globe – including
													‘World’s Best’ at the World Beer Awards – beating full-strength rivals in blind-tastings. Big
													Drop currently brews in Australia, Canada, the USA and the UK and is available in more than 20
													countries.
												</p>
												<p>
													The investment is part of a £3.5m round, with Panoramic investing alongside Rubix Ventures,
													Flexitalian, and existing investors, including Mark Hunter, who was chief executive of Molson
													Coors, and Stefan Orlowski, former head of Europe at Heineken.
												</p>
												<p>
													The team at Price Bailey provided critical insight into the business to provide Panoramic with
													the required comfort on their proposed investment. The work included a review of Big Drop's
													historical performance and a detailed understanding of its recent growth in a period impacted by
													the Pandemic.
												</p>
												<p>
													This helped to perform a critical review of the model, applying well-informed sensitivities to
													assess the impact of downturn performance and establish suitable mitigation for future cash flow
													needs.

												<p>On completion of the valuation in July 2020, the founders decided to pursue their desire to

													day-to-day running of the business and concentrate on the future succession.</p>
												<p>Working alongside their lawyer, we advised the founders on structuring the sale of 60% of the
													shares in the company to an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT). Having already conducted the
													valuation for the company, we worked with their management accountant to assess the current
													financial position, understand the cash and funding available for the EOT, and what future
													performance was expected. In addition, we conducted scenario planning with the founders in order
													to assess the impact of different structures for the EOT both for the business and with regard

											<p>The Strategic Corporate Finance team was engaged to carry out financial due diligence (FDD)
												into SafeGuard, a Peterborough-based glazing manufacturing company. Our reporting was focused on
												historical trading, balance sheet, cash flow and financial projections. We carried out a
												detailed review of their working capital position in order to ascertain what the true
												‘normalised’ position was, taking into account some recent changes in supplier trading
												conditions in 2021 and the impact of recent energy price rises.
											</p>
											<p>In addition, we worked closely alongside Foresight’s commercial due diligence (CDD) providers
												to establish current and ongoing anticipated demand levels for glazed products and whether the
												DIY and home refurb ‘bubble’ that was experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to
												continue. This enabled us to ascertain appropriate sensitivities to apply to the financial model
												for down-side scenario testing.</p>
											<p>As a result, the transaction was successfully completed, and SafeGuard can now focus on the

												<p>Price Bailey advised the owner shareholder on structuring the sale of 60% of his shares in
													Kerslake Construction Ltd to an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT). To do so, we first conducted a
													valuation for the company and ensured there was sufficient cash and funding available for the
													EOT both now and in the future. Once the terms of the EOT were agreed, the Strategic Corporate
													Finance and Tax teams at Price Bailey supported the founder by submitting an application for
													HMRC clearance on the proposed EOT transaction. Having successfully received clearance, the
													transaction was completed in January 2022.
												</p>
												<p>During the process of the transaction, one of the existing members of the management team, Jon
													Mortimer, became a Director alongside Will and together, they are already looking to capitalise
													on a number of potential growth opportunities available. Over time, this will also enable Will
													to step back from the business as he transitions toward retirement.</p>

												<p>Price Bailey played a crucial role in structuring the EOT; to allow the parties to make an

												</p>
												<p>Price Bailey provided an independent valuation of the business, structured the EOT repayment
													plan, and prepared and agreed on the tax clearance with HMRC to ensure eligibility in a timely

												<p>The legal structure of the EOT also established its official governance, with a carefully
													balanced mix of five trustees, of which two are employees elected by the employees.</p>
												<p>An EOT structure had been a key consideration for the vendors for some time. Once clarity was
